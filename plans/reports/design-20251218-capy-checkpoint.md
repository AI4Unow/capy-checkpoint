# Design Report: Capy-Checkpoint Mockups
**Date:** 2025-12-18
**Topic:** Kawaii/Cottagecore Math Game UI

## Overview
Successfully created 3 distinct game mockups for 'Capy-Checkpoint' using HTML/CSS. The design adheres to the Kawaii and Cottagecore aesthetic, featuring soft pastels, rounded shapes, and playful character elements.

## Design Decisions
- **Character:** Implemented a CSS-based Capybara with a Yuzu on its head, using floating animations to simulate flying.
- **HUD:** Designed a high-visibility HUD with heart icons for lives and a bordered coin counter, using the 'Fredoka' font for a friendly feel.
- **Level Themes:**
  - **Forest:** Sage green palette with hand-drawn style SVG trees and flower-decorated gates.
  - **Garden:** Giant flower emojis and lavender background to emphasize scale and nature.
  - **Sky:** Rainbow gradients and soft clouds with floating motion to create an airy, dreamlike atmosphere.
- **Typography:** Used 'Fredoka' for headings/UI and 'Baloo 2' for math answers to ensure readability and playfulness.

## Files Created
- `level1-forest.html`: Forest theme with multiplication question.
- `level2-garden.html`: Garden theme with fraction-to-decimal question.
- `level3-sky.html`: Sky/Rainbow theme with geometry question.
- `docs/design-guidelines.md`: Comprehensive design tokens and style rules.

## Unresolved Questions
- Should the Capybara have different accessories/hats for different levels?
- Is there a specific sound palette (SFX) that should match this visual style?
