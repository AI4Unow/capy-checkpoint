# Product Guidelines: Mathie

## Brand Personality
*   **Voice & Tone:** **Playful & Energetic.** The game speaks like an enthusiastic study buddy. It uses exclamation points, encouraging "cheerleader" language, and keeps the energy high to maintain engagement.
*   **Character Archetype:** **The Cheerful Explorer.** Our Capybara is bouncy, eager, and celebrates every milestone with high-fives and sparkles. They are the player's biggest fan.

## Visual Identity (Kawaii / Cottagecore)
*   **Aesthetic Direction:** **Pastel & Soft.** Despite the high energy, the visuals remain comforting.
    *   **Palette:** Light pinks (#FFD6E0), sage greens (#DDE5B6), and creamy yellows (#FEFAE0).
    *   **Shapes:** Everything is rounded and "squishy." No sharp edges or intimidating UI elements.
*   **UI/UX:** Bouncy animations, soft transitions, and "bubbly" buttons (using Baloo 2 typography).

## Gameplay Experience
*   **Feedback Loop:** **Energetic Motivation.** 
    *   When an answer is correct: A burst of sparkles and a satisfying "ding!"
    *   When an answer is incorrect: The Capybara does a quick "oops" tumble and respawns immediately with a message like "Almost had it! You'll get the next one!"
*   **Momentum:** The focus is on keeping the player moving. Mistakes are seen as minor speed bumps on a high-speed adventure, not reasons to stop.

## Content Guidelines
*   **Math Representation:** Math problems should be presented in clear, soft colors.
*   **Instructions:** Brief, action-oriented, and always positive.
